Air Quality Predictor 
This Model leverages the use of the real-time database from openaq.org

The model predicts the Particulate Matter in the Air over the next few hours based on the previous data that is being received in realtime by the model. 
It leverages the use of Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) to do this.

The build also provides a user friendly interface by integrating light and dark modes and visually pleasing web design. Additionally allowing us to choose the air quality of our desired state by clicking on any state on the Indian map.
The entire page is hosted on firebase which provides a web server to enable cross domain sharing and pull API requests if needed.
